#A simple interpreter of Scheme ([R5RS](http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/))

##introduction

This is the course project of Principle and Practice of Computer Algorithms 2013 (PPCA2013). The interpreter is designed to impterprete a subset of R5RS, including the basic function of this programming language.

For simplicity, I tacity assume that the identifier defined by the users is the combination of *letters*, *numbers* and *underscores*
which start with letter, others behavoir might be unpredictable.

And I suppose that users will never redefine the preserved keywords (e.g., *if* and *define*), e.g.,
    
    (define define 1)

I believe the users will not use the definition above. Redefining the built-in syntax is banned. You can redefine the built-in precedures. It might works, but sometimes may leads to unexpected outcomes.

##Syntax
The followings are available in the interpreter now.
* if, cond, case
* define
* lamdba

##Procedure
The followings are available in the interpreter now.

* +, -, \*, /
* <, >, <=, >=, eq?, eqv? equal?
* cons, car, cdr
* min, max

##Postscript
According to the requirement, the interpreter is programmed individually, but there are some inspiring talks with Zhuoyue Zhao, my classmate.
